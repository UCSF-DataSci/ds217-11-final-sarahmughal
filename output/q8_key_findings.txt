KEY FINDINGS SUMMARY
====================

MODEL PERFORMANCE:
- Best performing model: XGBoost (Test R² = 0.7897)
- This model also achieves a low RMSE of 4.65, indicating strong predictive accuracy.
- Linear Regression performed worst, while Random Forest performed well but slightly below XGBoost.

FEATURE IMPORTANCE:
Top 5 most influential predictors:
- Wet Bulb Temperature (importance: 0.6242)
- Battery Life (importance: 0.1850)
- Humidity (importance: 0.0546)
- Barometric Pressure (importance: 0.0409)
- Wind Direction (importance: 0.0288)

INSIGHTS:
- Tree-based models (Random Forest and XGBoost) outperform Linear Regression, suggesting important nonlinear relationships in the data.
- Feature importances indicate which environmental factors most strongly influence temperature predictions.
- Predictions vs actual values show that the best model captures patterns well with moderate residual spread.

DATA QUALITY SUMMARY:
- Missing values were handled using forward/backward fill and 0-filling for rain-related variables.
- Outliers were capped using the IQR method across all numeric features.
- Final cleaned dataset retained the full set of 39256 prediction rows.
